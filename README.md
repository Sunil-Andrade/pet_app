**Connecting loving homes with adorable pets in need. PetConnect is a mobile-first platform dedicated to making pet adoption a simple, joyful, and seamless experience.**

## 🌟 Overview

PetConnect is a UI demonstration showcasing a clean and user-friendly design for a pet adoption platform. I did not design this interface; it is used here solely for demonstration purposes. The project focuses purely on layout and interface elements—there is no real adoption data or backend functionality included. It serves as a visual example of how a pet adoption app might look and feel.
